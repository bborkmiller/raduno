# Lavu Functions

This code is intended to pull data out of the Lavu POS system using Lavu's API and then load it into a local MySQL database, where it can then be processed and analyzed. The code was designed to work for a specific site, so it's not very generalized.

The code that contacts the Lavu interface and wrangles the results was heavily copied from Troy Kelly's work presented in [this thread on the Lavu forums](http://talk.lavu.com/ipad-pos-topic/cashier-sales-style-report-with-php-393/#comment-1952).
